Exploring Mushrooms

`exploring_mushrooms.ipynb` is one of the off-platform codecademy project where we visualize dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification), which is loaded in `mushroom_data.csv`, turning 20+ columns as bar chart and pie chart using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `for` loops. 

Here, we're going to:
1. look over the dataset by inspecting the column using `.head()`, checking the unique value for each column using `.unique()`.
2. plot the bar chart(with seaborn) & the pie chart(with matplotlib) using `for` loops since we have more than 20 columns.
3. adjust and format the proportion for the pie chart in percentage.
4. adjust the x-tick labels, the bar in descending order, the bar `color` and `fontsize` for better readability.
