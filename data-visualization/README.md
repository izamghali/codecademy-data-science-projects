# Data Visualization

This directory consists of data visualization projects from codecademy

So far we have:
1. exploring-mushrooms directory. Here we visualize mushroom dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification), turning 20+ columns into bar charts(with `seaborn`) and pie charts(with `matplotlib`) using `for` loops. 

2. life-expectancy-and-GDP directory. In this project we plot life expectancy at birth (years) against GDP in Trillions of USD$ for 6 countries using scatterplot, looking at its correlation.[Here](https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/paths/data-science/Life-Expectancy-and-GDP-Starter.zip?_gl=1*1xshgne*_ga*MTU4NTUxNDI3Mi4xNjc2Nzk4MTU2*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY4MTc5NjQxOC4yNDYuMC4xNjgxNzk2NDE4LjYwLjAuMA..) is the dataset we use for this project. The dataset consists of 4 columns: `Country`, `Years`, `Life Expectancy`, and `GDP`. Questions we're trying to answer include:
  - does GDP of a country correlates to its life expectancy?
  - How is the change of GDP of a country throughout the years?
  - What country has the highest and the lowest GDP? and how long can its citizen expect to live there?
