Hurrican analysis

hurricane_analysis is one of the off-platform codecademy project where we pretend to be an environmentalist who look and play around at the hurricane dataset. 

We're asked:
1. to create functions to convert money in strings to float (either billion or million), 
2. to reconstruct dictionaries, 
3. to rearrange dictionaries based on years, 
4. to find the hurricane that caused the most mortality rate, and 
5. rating the hurricanes data based on the damages.
