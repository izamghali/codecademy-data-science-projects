Coded Correspondence

coded_correspondence is an off-platform codecademy project where we encode and decode messages from Vishal, our fictional cryptography enthusiast pen pal.

Throughout the project, here's the tasks we need to accomplish:
    1. Decode Vishal's first message using Ceasar Cipher with offset of 10
    2. Encode our reply back to Vishal using Ceasar Cipher 
    3. Crete functions to encode and decode Ceasar Cipher
    4. Decode the message without knowing the offset
    5. Create a function to decode and encode message using a more complex method, Vigen√®re Cipher
